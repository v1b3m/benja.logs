## PROBLEM

**Three in One:** Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.

### HINTS

**#2:** A stack is simply a data structure in which the most recently added elements are removed first. Can you simulate a single stack using an array? Remember that there are many possible solutions, and there are tradeoffs of each.
{: .notice--primary}

**#12:** We could simulate three stacks in an array by just allocating the first third of the array to the first stack, the second third to the second stack, and the final third to the third stack. One might actually be much bigger than the others, though. Can we be more flexible with the divisions? 
{: .notice--warning}

**#38:** If you want to allow for flexible divisions, you can shift stacks around. Can you ensure that all available capacity is used?
{: .notice--success}

**#58:** Try thinking about the array as circular, such that the end of the array "wraps around"to the start of the array.

## SOLUTION

Implementing three stacks using a single array can be accomplished using a variety of techniques. Below, we'll explore two methods to address this problem: **Fixed Division** and **Flexible Division**.

### Fixed Division Method:

In this method, we divide the array into three equal parts, each serving as a stack. This approach is simple but may not use space optimally if one stack has more elements than the others.

Here's a TypeScript implementation:

```typescript
class TripleStackFixed {
  private array: number[];
  private n: number;
  private top1: number;
  private top2: number;
  private top3: number;

  constructor(size: number) {
    this.array = new Array(size).fill(null);
    this.n = Math.floor(size / 3);
    this.top1 = 0;
    this.top2 = this.n;
    this.top3 = 2 * this.n;
  }

  push(stackNum: number, value: number): void {
    switch (stackNum) {
      case 1:
        if (this.top1 < this.n) {
          this.array[this.top1] = value;
          this.top1++;
        } else {
          console.log("Stack 1 Overflow!");
        }
        break;
      case 2:
        if (this.top2 < 2 * this.n) {
          this.array[this.top2] = value;
          this.top2++;
        } else {
          console.log("Stack 2 Overflow!");
        }
        break;
      case 3:
        if (this.top3 < 3 * this.n) {
          this.array[this.top3] = value;
          this.top3++;
        } else {
          console.log("Stack 3 Overflow!");
        }
        break;
      default:
        console.log("Invalid stack number.");
    }
  }

  pop(stackNum: number): number | null {
    let value = null;
    switch (stackNum) {
      case 1:
        if (this.top1 > 0) {
          this.top1--;
          value = this.array[this.top1];
          this.array[this.top1] = null;
        } else {
          console.log("Stack 1 Underflow!");
        }
        break;
      case 2:
        if (this.top2 > this.n) {
          this.top2--;
          value = this.array[this.top2];
          this.array[this.top2] = null;
        } else {
          console.log("Stack 2 Underflow!");
        }
        break;
      case 3:
        if (this.top3 > 2 * this.n) {
          this.top3--;
          value = this.array[this.top3];
          this.array[this.top3] = null;
        } else {
          console.log("Stack 3 Underflow!");
        }
        break;
      default:
        console.log("Invalid stack number.");
    }
    return value;
  }
}
```

### Flexible Division Method (Dynamic):

In this approach, we allow stacks to grow and shrink dynamically, thereby utilizing the space more efficiently. We'll employ the concept of a "circular array" as suggested in Hint #58.

To do this:

1. **Array Pointers**: Keep track of the `start`, `end`, and `size` for each stack.
2. **Insertion**: When inserting an element into a stack, check if there's available space next to it. If not, move the adjacent stack to make room.

Here's a simplified TypeScript example, implementing dynamic allocation:

```typescript
class TripleStackDynamic {
  private array: number[];
  private pointers: { start: number; end: number; size: number }[];

  constructor(size: number) {
    this.array = new Array(size).fill(null);
    const third = Math.floor(size / 3);
    this.pointers = [
      { start: 0, end: third, size: 0 },
      { start: third, end: 2 * third, size: 0 },
      { start: 2 * third, end: size, size: 0 }
    ];
  }

  push(stackNum: number, value: number): void {
    const pointer = this.pointers[stackNum - 1];
    if (pointer.size < pointer.end - pointer.start) {
      this.array[pointer.start + pointer.size] = value;
      pointer.size++;
    } else {
      console.log(`Stack ${stackNum} Overflow!`);
      // Here you can implement logic to shift stacks and make room
    }
  }

  pop(stackNum: number): number | null {
    const pointer = this.pointers[stackNum - 1];
    if (pointer.size > 0) {
      pointer.size--;
      const value = this.array[pointer.start + pointer.size];
      this.array[pointer.start + pointer.size] = null;
      return value;
    } else {
      console.log(`Stack ${stackNum} Underflow!`);
      return null;
    }
  }
}
```

The above example implements the basic dynamic stack but doesn't include the logic to shift stacks when they overflow. That would involve more intricate logic to ensure that all stacks have room to grow and might even require resizing the array or moving all elements.

Both methods have their trade-offs: the Fixed Division is easier to implement but might waste space, whereas the Flexible Division utilizes space better but is more complex to manage.

## Flexible Division Deeper Dive

Let's delve deeper into the Flexible Division Method (Dynamic), specifically on how to handle the overflow by shifting the stacks.

The idea here is to make room for a stack when it overflows by redistributing the available space among the stacks or shifting stacks over to fill any unused spaces.

### Handling Overflow in the Flexible Division:

1. **Check for Total Overflow**: Before attempting to make space for the overflowing stack, ensure that there is available space in the array. If the sum of the sizes of the three stacks equals the array length, then the array is completely full.

2. **Shift Over**: If one stack overflows, move the next stack over to make room. This operation requires moving all elements of the next stack. After you've moved the second stack, you may also need to move the third stack.

3. **Redistribute Space**: After moving elements over, redistribute the available spaces among the stacks. 

Here's the extended TypeScript example, including logic to handle overflow by shifting:

```typescript
class TripleStackDynamic {
  // Internal array to hold the values for all three stacks.
  private array: number | null[];

  // Pointers to keep track of each stack's start, end, and current size.
  private pointers: { start: number; end: number; size: number }[];

  // Initializes the internal array and sets up pointers for each of the three stacks.
  constructor(size: number) {
    this.array = new Array(size).fill(null);
    const third = Math.floor(size / 3);

    // Dividing the internal array into three parts for the stacks.
    this.pointers = [
      { start: 0, end: third, size: 0 },
      { start: third, end: 2 * third, size: 0 },
      { start: 2 * third, end: size, size: 0 },
    ];
  }

  // Pushes a value onto one of the three stacks.
  push(stackNum: number, value: number): void {
    const pointer = this.pointers[stackNum - 1];

    // If there's space in the chosen stack, add the value.
    if (pointer.size < pointer.end - pointer.start) {
      this.array[pointer.start + pointer.size] = value;
      pointer.size++;
    } else {
      // Try to shift the stacks to make room and then push the value.
      if (this.shift(stackNum)) {
        this.push(stackNum, value);
      } else {
        console.log(`Stack ${stackNum} Overflow!`);
      }
    }
  }

  // Shifts stacks to the right to make room in a full stack.
  // Only the second and third stacks can be shifted.
  shift(stackNum: number): boolean {
    if (stackNum === 1 || stackNum === 2) {
      const nextPointer = this.pointers[stackNum];

      // If there's space in the next stack, shift its values right.
      if (nextPointer.size < nextPointer.end - nextPointer.start) {
        for (
          let i = nextPointer.start + nextPointer.size - 1;
          i >= nextPointer.start;
          i--
        ) {
          this.array[i + 1] = this.array[i];
        }
        nextPointer.start++;
        nextPointer.end++;
        this.pointers[stackNum - 1].end++;
        return true;
      }
      // If the current stack can't be shifted, try shifting the next stack.
      // If successful, shift the current stack.
      else if (this.shift(stackNum + 1)) {
        return this.shift(stackNum);
      }
    }
    return false;
  }

  // Pops a value from one of the three stacks.
  pop(stackNum: number): number | null {
    const pointer = this.pointers[stackNum - 1];

    // If the chosen stack is not empty, remove and return the top value.
    if (pointer.size > 0) {
      pointer.size--;
      const value = this.array[pointer.start + pointer.size];
      this.array[pointer.start + pointer.size] = null;
      return value;
    } else {
      console.log(`Stack ${stackNum} Underflow!`);
      return null;
    }
  }
}
```

In this approach:

- The `push` method first checks if there's room in the target stack. If not, it attempts to shift the next stack over with the `shift` method.
- The `shift` method recursively tries to shift the next stack to make room. It only shifts if there's space in the next stack or if it can shift the subsequent stack. The method returns `true` if shifting succeeded and `false` otherwise.

While this method utilizes space better than the Fixed Division approach, it can be slower, especially when frequent shifts are required. You might also consider resizing the array when it's full to avoid shifting altogether, but that would be a different approach.
