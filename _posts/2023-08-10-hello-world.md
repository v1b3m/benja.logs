Greetings to the world! It's Ben, making a return to the realm of writing after quite a hiatus. It's a bit of a challenge to decide where to begin, considering the time that's passed. Nonetheless, I'm taking the leap and penning down my thoughts right here. This endeavor brings to mind the notion of "Thinking on paper." So, I'm embracing that concept as I embark on this creative journey.

My days have been filled with a multitude of endeavors: lines of code meticulously crafted, a wealth of knowledge eagerly absorbed, numerous books devoured, podcasts and videos resonating in my ears, and a host of tasks conscientiously tackled.

I'll share the main things from each of those categories that I've been focusing on a lot lately.

I've also delved into the realm of generative A.I. art. I've been diving into the [Stable Diffusion][stable-diffusion-web-ui] platform, a wonderful tool for crafting A.I. art. Through this platform, I've been crafting captivating artworks that have captured my imagination. I'm excited to showcase a few of my personal favorites below.
