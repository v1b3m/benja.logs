## PROBLEM

How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1) time.

### HINTS

**27** Observe that the minimum element doesn't change very often. It only changes when a  smaller element is added, or when the smallest element is popped.
{: .notice--primary}

**59** What if we kept track of extra data at each stack node? What sort of data might make it easier to solve the problem?
{: .notice--success}

**78** Consider having each node know the minimum of its "substack" (all the elements beneath it, including itself).
{: .notice--warning}

## SOLUTION

Given the third hint, we can modify the stack node to keep track of the minimum value beneath it (including itself). This way, the top node of the stack always knows the minimum value in the current state of the stack. 

Here's how the solution looks with this approach:

```typescript
class Node {
  value: number;
  minBelow: number;

  constructor(value: number, minBelow: number) {
    this.value = value;
    this.minBelow = minBelow;
  }
}

class StackWithMin {
  private stack: Node[] = [];

  push(value: number): void {
    const minBelow =
      this.stack.length === 0 ? value : Math.min(value, this.min());
    const newNode = new Node(value, minBelow);
    this.stack.push(newNode);
  }

  pop(): number | null {
    if (this.stack.length === 0) return null;
    const node = this.stack.pop();
    return node ? node.value : null;
  }

  min(): number | null {
    return this.stack.length > 0
      ? this.stack[this.stack.length - 1].minBelow
      : null;
  }
}

// Testing the stack.
const stack = new StackWithMin();
stack.push(5);
console.log(stack.min()); // Expected: 5
stack.push(3);
console.log(stack.min()); // Expected: 3
stack.push(4);
console.log(stack.min()); // Expected: 3
stack.pop();
console.log(stack.min()); // Expected: 3
stack.pop();
console.log(stack.min()); // Expected: 5
```

In this approach, the `push`, `pop`, and `min` operations are still O(1). We use a bit more space per element in the stack (to store the minimum), but we reduce the overall complexity by ensuring we always know the minimum at the top of the stack.

## EXTRA SOLUTION

To solve this problem, we can maintain an auxiliary stack that will keep track of the minimum value seen so far. When we perform a push operation on the main stack, we compare the new element with the current top of the auxiliary stack and push the smaller value onto the auxiliary stack.

When we pop an element from the main stack, we also pop from the auxiliary stack. This ensures that the auxiliary stack's top always contains the minimum value from the main stack.

Here's the implementation for this approach:

```typescript
class StackWithMin {
  // Main stack to store all values.
  private mainStack: number[] = [];

  // Auxiliary stack to keep track of the minimum values.
  private minStack: number[] = [];

  // Pushes a new value onto the main stack and updates the auxiliary stack.
  push(value: number): void {
    this.mainStack.push(value);

    // If the auxiliary stack is empty or the new value is less than its top,
    // push the new value. Otherwise, repeat the current top.
    if (
      this.minStack.length === 0 ||
      value < this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]
    ) {
      this.minStack.push(value);
    } else {
      this.minStack.push(this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]);
    }
  }

  // Pops the top value from the main stack and updates the auxiliary stack.
  pop(): number | null {
    if (this.mainStack.length === 0) return null;
    this.minStack.pop();
    return this.mainStack.pop();
  }

  // Returns the top value from the main stack without removing it.
  top(): number | null {
    return this.mainStack.length > 0
      ? this.mainStack[this.mainStack.length - 1]
      : null;
  }

  // Returns the current minimum value from the main stack without removing it.
  min(): number | null {
    return this.minStack.length > 0
      ? this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]
      : null;
  }
}

// Testing the stack.
const stack = new StackWithMin();
stack.push(5);
console.log(stack.min()); // Expected: 5
stack.push(3);
console.log(stack.min()); // Expected: 3
stack.push(4);
console.log(stack.min()); // Expected: 3
stack.pop();
console.log(stack.min()); // Expected: 3
stack.pop();
console.log(stack.min()); // Expected: 5
```

With this approach, all three operations (`push`, `pop`, and `min`) operate in constant O(1) time as required.
