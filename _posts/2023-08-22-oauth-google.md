How do we know if the user is using oauth or not?

## Logging in with Google

I've failed to enable OAuth login with Google, I keep getting stuck on the error screen below

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/work/accounts.google.com_signin_oauth_error_authError=Cg9pbnZhbGlkX3JlcXVlc3QS3gEKWW91IGNhbid0IHNpZ24gaW4gdG8gdGhpcyBhcHAgYmVjYXVzZSBpdCBkb2Vzbid0IGNvbXBseSB3aXRoIEdvb2dsZSdzIE9BdXRoIDIuMCBwb2xpY3kgZm9yIGtlZXBpbmcgYXBwcyBzZWN1cmUuCgpZb3UgY2FuIGx.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="" %}

### Following the provided links has also proven not to be very useful:

- [Learn more about this error](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/policies#secure-response-handling)
- [error details](https://accounts.google.com/)

#### Learning more about the error

So, from the link, we learn that:

> Google may reject OAuth requests that don't originate from or resolve to a secure context.

##### Let's assume our OAuth requests are insecure! Where do we go from there?

We need to secure our OAuth requests

1. **Do our requests originate from a secure context**

   Our requests originate from a local server that is running over http.

2. **Do our requests resolve to a secure context**

   Prolly!

### Do we need to have OAuth working for us to fix the bug?

Prolly not!

## TFA Management

In the admin settings, you can enable/disable 2FA.

There's a bunch of utilities that handle TFA in `app/src/composables/use-tfa-setup.ts`

The `utils` are used by two files:

- `app/src/interfaces/_system/system-mfa-setup/system-mfa-setup.vue`
- `app/src/routes/tfa-setup.vue`

## Brainstorming

**NOTICE:** I'm not very good at Vue, so I gotta figure this shit out along the way.

I am trying to determine the setting change when oauth is used 

The google URI:

```
https://accounts.google.com/signin/oauth/error/v2?authError=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&client_id=25926454862-vgbe0fuo0hp125vjq59q6bmoqftf1rft.apps.googleusercontent.com

Log in with Google button
```
http://localhost:8080/auth/login/google?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Fadmin%2Flogin%3Freason%3DSIGN_OUT%26continue%3D

Redirect: `http://localhost:8080/admin/login?reason=SIGN_OUT&continue=`
